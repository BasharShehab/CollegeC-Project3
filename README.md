# CollegeC-Project3
the 3rd and last file of my C++ project of my first semester at ASPU

this program does the following 

    function "read" that reads 'A', a 1D array
    function "write" that prints out array 'A'.
    function "sum" that prints out the sum of all elements of array 'A'.
    function "minmax" that returns the largest and smallest number in array 'A'.
    function "avarg" that returns the SMA of array 'A'.
    function "STD" which returns the standard deviation of elements in array 'A'.
    
this file completes the project that I did for college in my first semester.
