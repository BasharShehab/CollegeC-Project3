# Math operations on arrays.

this program does the following 

    function "read" that reads 'A', a 1D array
    function "write" that prints out array 'A'.
    function "sum" that prints out the sum of all elements of array 'A'.
    function "minmax" that returns the largest and smallest number in array 'A'.
    function "avarg" that returns the SMA of array 'A'.
    function "STD" which returns the standard deviation of elements in array 'A'.
    
that's all. Have fun!
